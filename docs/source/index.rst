4th Sem Lab Computational Physics documentation
===============================================

This course introduces learners to the fundamentals of numerical computation using Python. The primary goal is to develop a solid understanding of how to perform numerical interpolation and integration techniques. Students will also gain hands-on experience by writing Python code to implement these methods, helping bridge theoretical concepts with practical application.
